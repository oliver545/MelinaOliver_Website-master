        For this project, I wanted to focus on expanding on projects 4 and 5. This project involved a lot of experimenting with WEBGL spheres, directional light, arrays, and functions. I wanted to show some 3D planets that moved, and once the user pressed a mouse button, stars would appear. This project allowed me to dig into functions and arrays, and how they interact with each other. I learned how to use many of my functions through trial and error, as well as looking up new info on p5js.org and Youtube.
