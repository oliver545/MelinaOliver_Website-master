    <p>
    I got my scuba certification from <a href="https://columbusscuba.com/">Columbus Scuba</a> <br>
    My deepest dive was 100 ft and it was very cold. I have not been in awhile but would love to go again! <br>
    This reminds of a podcast I listened to that talked about <a href="https://dan.org/safety-prevention/diver-safety/divers-blog/treating-decompression-sickness-the-bends/">The Bends</a> <br>
    Very scary!! <br>
