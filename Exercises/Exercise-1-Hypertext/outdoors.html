   <p>
    I enjoy being in the outdoors and traveling to <a href="nationalparks.html">National Parks</a>. <br>
    One of my favorite trips was to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chir/index.htm">Chiricahua Mountains</a> in <a href="./arizona.html">Arizona</a> <br>
    I enjoy <a href="./backpacking.html">backpacking</a> and hiking. <br>
    I also believe wildlife <a href="./conservation.html">conservation</a> is super important, and always keep it in mind when I am exploring backcountry areas. <br>
