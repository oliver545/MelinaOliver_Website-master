        <h4> 01/24/23</h4>
        <p>
            So far this week has been a much needed review for me. 
            I have a little bit of prior experience in html and css from a previous class. 
            The shortcuts that were mentioned during class were very helpful and will hopefully make my life easier when coding! 
            To recap this week, some big things we learned were how to:
            <ul>
                <li>create an html and css file</li>
                <li>use w3 schools</li>
                <li>add color and style other items through css</li>
                <li>add images and links</li>
            </ul>
            These were all great refreshers for me. 
            I did not use w3 schools when I was learning html & css, so I will make sure to make great use out of this resource. 
            On Friday, I gave a presentation about the Internet in general. 
            Something that I thought was interesting was Microsoft Bob. 
            In design, its always said that the more intuitive a design is the better. 
            However, Microsoft Bob is a great example of how you can go too far with intuition and rely on the "old" way of things too much. 
            Having a healthy balance between intuition and practiciality is always important. 
            Overall I'm very excited about the things I will learn in this class! Here are some images that I enjoy looking at:

            This week we learned about how to link several HTML pages together using the a tag like 
            this This can be useful for when I am making a website and want it to have interactive buttons with several pages.
             I am excited about the Hypertext exercise and am still thinking about how i want to stucture it. Right now I'm making it 
             an "About Me" page that will go into two of my hobbies and my major. I'm still thinking about how I can make the pages seem more fun to go through. The examples shown for this exercise really helped me start to figure out how I want to structure this assignment. Although it say no CSS right now, I'm thinking I might add CSS later so for my portfolio. I'm excited to be learning more about HTML and CSS since many of the internships I'm looking into right now prefer candiates with some HTML and CSS knowledge. The Five Variations exercise also looks intersting. I especially enjoyed Theresa Castellucci's site that showcased this exercise. I'm excited to start using more CSS for ths exercise.
            Something that I was struggling with last week was being able to change the font to the ones I picked out. 
            I originally had two specific font picked out and then had the backup as sans serif. However, when I opened it in the live server it 
            automattically defaulted to the sans serif typface. Im wondering what I can do to make the brower show my picked out fonts, or if the live server is just unable to show speacial fonts. 
            Overall, this week was a mix of refresher and learning something new! I am very excited to see where the next week leads me.

            This week we went over excecise 1 & 2 in class. After going over the excersies I 
            am inspired to explore more things i can do with CSS. I also think I would like to 
            go back and add CSS to my excerise 1. The other thing I wanted to do was create was
            a story that used a tags. I saw a couple people did click and point stories which 
            inspired me. Im taking a game design class right now too and think that I could 
            combine the conent im learning in my game design class with the exercise 1.
            Another class that I'm yaking right now is a Collab deisng class with all three 
            deisng majors (Visual Communication, Interior, Industrial). This class is exploring 
            the future of technology, how to try to predict what technology will succeed, and 
            exploring how to use new technology. I'm hopeing that I can use the skills that I 
            learn in this class to my collab class. The professor mentioned at the beggining of 
            the clss that we couold have the opporitunity to explore areas on the internet/ new
            tech so I'm hoping that I will have the chance to use some HTML/CSS for one of the 
            future projects.
            Some random things that are happening in my life is I'm starting to play Minecraft 
            again. I got inspired by some cool builds that have popped up on my tiktok and whated 
            to try playing again with the intent being to build a cool house or town.
            Lastly, I'm really excited about building a portfolio page. TYhis is somthing I have
            been wanting to do for awhile and I found many sites that I am inspired by. I hope 
            to be able to build a site that is shows my aestheic and my html/css skills for my 
            portfolio.

        <h2> Weekly D</h2>
        <h4> 02/12/23</h4>
        <p>
            This week we presented our website designs and had studio time to get started on 
            Project 1. I felt super inspired by everyone else's inspiration websites and their 
            plans! I planned for mine to be more of a standard portfolio that I can show future 
            employers. After seeing everyone else's ideas I'm thinking about keeping my original 
            design and then having separate pages that the user could click on to try out 
            different experiences. I want to create something that is interactive and makes the 
            user want to click around. Here are some changes I'm thinking about:
            <ul>
                <li>turning the boxes for the pages into fun shapes</li>
                <li>turning the boxes into "portals" that are interactive spheres, maybe they turn when the mouse hovers over them?</li>   
            </ul>
            Pages ideas to explore:
            <ul>
                <li>make a small clicking game</li>
                <li>make something that the user must navigate using their arrow keys</li>
                <li>make something that full of interesting things that happen when the user scrolls</li>   
            </ul>
            I want to include some more of the fun stuff that I saw from my 
            inspiration websites. Right now I need to figure out how to change the font to 
            something more interesting. I also need to figure out how I'm going to add the page 
            images within my "work" section. Another thing is I want to figure out how to make a 
            smooth transition between the main landing page and the "work" section of my page. 
            Lastly, I want my main landing page to take up the entire screen no matter what 
            device it is on. I originally was using pixel dimensions to define the space, but 
            the page needs to be flexible for other devices, therefore defining pixels will not 
            work forever.

        <h4> 03/05/23</h4>
        <p>
            This week we went over our websites and started learning p5.js. 
            After looking at everyone's website I felt very inspired to create another 
            website that is more expressive/ fun to interact with. I started mapping out 
            an idea that is based on my bedroom wall decoration and Rusty Lake's Cube 
            Escape games. My bedroom wall is decorated with an assortment of knick-knacks that I 
            collected from events, travels, art, and anything else I've found interesting. I want 
            my website to have a similar wall as its homepage, with some of the different objects 
            leading to my weekly post or exercises. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The website would start with a blank home screen with an old brick house. The visitor 
            would then click on the door and enter the living room, seeing the wall full of knick-knacks. 
            The user could then explore the house, leading to the kitchen, a gallery wall, and 
            the front where the visitor could exit. I want the website to incorporate interesting
            ways to navigate through scrolling, and incorporate some easter eggs that don't seem 
            clickable until hovering over it. Overall, I want my new website to be much more fun to 
            interact with and much less formal. My goal is to get it done before the end of the 
            semester. I may start it and just incorperate the basic ideas so that I can use it 
            for my class portfolio.

        <p>
            This week we learned about P5 JavaScript! 
            This was super fun to experiment with. 
            While working on exercise 4, I started playing around 
            with loops and if: else statements. Currently, I have a 
            lot of circles that grow inside one another, almost like 
            an optical illusion which I thought was cool. For my math 
            problem, I added circles that grow exponentially. 
            I'm still playing around with this function and how I want 
            it to work in my project. Right now it starts at the top 
            left, and I'm trying to figure out how to make it start 
            from the other corners too.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing I'm still working on is getting my website to 
            work on Git. I'm still unsure what's causing the problem. 
            I might download the repository from Git and then try 
            updating that file instead. I have not started my new fun 
            website because I want to try to get my original website to 
            work first.

            Spring break is next week! I'm excited to have a break. 
            I'm also going on a hiking trip to Colorado over break 
            that I'm excited about. Right now I'm trying to get all 
            my work done for the week and the Monday after break so 
            that I can sleep when I get back lol.
